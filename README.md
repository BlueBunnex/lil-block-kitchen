# Lil' Block Kitchen

A small Minecraft cooking mod that adds new cooking recipes, because steak kills any reason to farm, y'know. Currently built for 1.21.1.

I am still learning and this mod is probably gonna be. so gross but it's ok how else do you learn

Made with love and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:start).

## Recipes

### Crafting table

| Ingredients | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Wheat x3, Seed Oil, Sugar | Pastry Dough |

## Planned

6 brick + 3 iron -> Cooktop

In the cooktop, you combine a base + filling + topping to get a food, ex. pastry dough + chocolate + sugar -> chocolate croissants

seeds -> Seed Oil (may or may not replace seed oil in recipes with egg)

seed oil + wheat + water + beet -> Beet Focaccia

egg + chocolate + frying pan -> chocolate egg

pizza? beet icecream? chocolate croissants? chocolate (choco bar)?
