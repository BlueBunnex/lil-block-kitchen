# Lil' Block Kitchen

A small Minecraft cooking mod that adds new cooking recipes, because steak kills any reason to farm, y'know. Currently built for 1.21.1.

Made with love and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:start).

> [!NOTE]  
> I am still learning and this mod is probably gonna be. so gross but it's ok how else do you learn. like genuinely no idea how mixins work, so I'll probably experiment with them in a blank project before trying to shoehorn them into this

## Recipes

### Crafting table

| Ingredients | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Wheat x3 | Dough |
| Wheat x3, Seed Oil, Sugar | Pastry Dough |
| Milk Bucket, Sugar, Cocoa Beans | Chocolate |
| Egg, Chocolate | Chocolate Egg |

### Furnace/Campfire
| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Dough | Bread |

## Planned (maybe)

snowball + sugar + milk + beetroot -> Beet Icecream (maybe also chocolate)

wheat + egg + sugar + beetroot -> Beet Cake (four slices)

wheat + egg + sugar + carrot -> Carrot Cake

pastry dough + chocolate + sugar -> chocolate croissants

pizza?

If I found out how to make a "Pan" item return itself in recipes that use it, I could have this Pan item (stick + iron) used for certain recipes like Breaded Chicken (pan + egg + bread + chicken)...
