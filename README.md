# Lil' Block Kitchen

A small Minecraft cooking mod that adds new cooking recipes, because steak kills any reason to farm, y'know. Currently built for 1.21.1.

Made with love and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:start).

> [!NOTE]  
> I am still learning and this mod is probably gonna be. so gross but it's ok how else do you learn. like genuinely no idea how mixins work, so I'll probably experiment with them in a blank project before trying to shoehorn them into this

## Planned (maybe)

### Misc

pride cookie with all dyes lol, also chocolate cookie

snowball + sugar + milk + beetroot -> Beet Icecream (maybe also chocolate)

pizza?

If I found out how to make a "Pan" item return itself in recipes that use it, I could have this Pan item (stick + iron) used for certain recipes like Breaded Chicken (pan + egg + bread + chicken)...

### Pies/Tarts

Pastry Dough + Mould? Tray? -> Unbaked Pie Crust -> bake -> Pie Crust

### Cake

2 sugar, 2 egg, 2 wheat, milk bucket -> batter bucket (smelt to make plain cake) 

plain cake + sugar + beetroot -> Beet Cake (four slices)

plain cake + sugar + carrot -> Carrot Cake (four slices)
