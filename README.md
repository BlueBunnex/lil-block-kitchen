# Lil' Block Kitchen

A small Minecraft cooking mod that adds new cooking recipes, because steak kills any reason to farm, y'know. Currently built for 1.21.1.

Made with love and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:start).

> [!NOTE]  
> I am still learning how to mod, and also have a lot of stress with managing projects like this. But that's OK! I'll get through it and make something nice from it too.

## Bushes

Though currently unobtainable, there are bushes for strawberries and blueberries.

## Roadmap

snowball + sugar + milk + beetroot -> Beet Icecream (maybe also chocolate)

pizza? muffins?

coffee bush, which gives you coffee... berries? that you smelt to get roasted coffee beans, that you can turn into coffee (that gives speed)

pastry dough + sugar + beetroot -> Beet Cake (four slices)

pastry dough + sugar + carrot -> Carrot Cake (four slices)
