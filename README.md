# Lil' Block Kitchen

A small Minecraft cooking mod that adds new cooking recipes, because steak kills any reason to farm, y'know. Currently built for 1.21.1.

Made with love and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:start).

> [!NOTE]  
> I am still learning how to mod, and also have a lot of stress with managing projects like this. But that's OK! I'll get through it and make something nice from it too.

## Roadmap

Clean up code/remove unused features; Have a good selection of simple foodstuffs to craft; Have bushes (strawberry, blueberry) fully implemented.

pride cookie with all dyes, also chocolate cookie

snowball + sugar + milk + beetroot -> Beet Icecream (maybe also chocolate)

pizza?

If I found out how to make a "Pan" item return itself in recipes that use it, I could have this Pan item (stick + iron) used for certain recipes like Breaded Chicken (pan + egg + bread + chicken)...

pastry dough + sugar + beetroot -> Beet Cake (four slices)

pastry dough + sugar + carrot -> Carrot Cake (four slices)
